☢️ OFFICIAL VAULT‑TEC PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION TO ALL SURVIVORS, MUTANTS, AND SHAREHOLDERS
VAULT‑TEC CORPORATION  
“Building a Brighter Tomorrow, Yesterday.”

January 2077 (Reissued 2026)  
Vault‑77, Mojave Exclusion Zone

VAULT‑TEC ANNOUNCES THE RETURN OF THE ATOMIC FIZZ CAPS PROGRAM
“The Future of Currency Is Glowing.”
Vault‑Tec is proud (and legally obligated) to announce the relaunch of its groundbreaking Atomic Fizz Caps Initiative, a revolutionary economic system designed to bring stability, prosperity, and mild radiation poisoning to the post‑nuclear American wasteland.

Originally conceived as a promotional tie‑in for the failed soft drink Atomic Fizz™, the caps have since become the de facto currency of the Mojave, thanks to their durability, collectability, and faint but comforting luminescence.

Today, Vault‑Tec is thrilled to unveil the Vault‑77 Wasteland GPS, a Pip‑Boy–powered scavenging platform that allows survivors to:

Explore irradiated ruins

Claim real‑world locations

Earn glowing soda caps

Level up their survival rank

Collect gear of questionable origin

And participate in the thriving post‑apocalyptic economy

All from the comfort of their Pip‑Boy wrist-mounted survival assistant.

“A New Era of Scavenging Begins,” Says Vault‑Tec Spokesperson
Vault‑Tec spokesperson Dr. Harold Fizzworth, speaking through a heavily filtered intercom system, stated:

“Atomic Fizz Caps represents the next evolution of wasteland commerce.
We believe every survivor deserves the opportunity to earn currency by walking directly into dangerous areas.
It’s what capitalism is all about.”

Dr. Fizzworth was later escorted away by security after attempting to drink a sample of raw coolant.
