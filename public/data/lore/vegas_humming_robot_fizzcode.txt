The robot still hummed, even after all these years. Its chassis was half-buried in Mojave dust, servos locked, optics dead. Whatever it had once been—Securitron, utility unit, courier drone—time had stripped away its purpose. But something inside it refused to die.

A low, rhythmic vibration pulsed from its core. Not power. Not life. Code. The Overseer’s code.

A fragment of Vault 77’s forgotten operating system, still looping inside a machine that had succumbed to the wasteland long ago. The robot’s shell was gone, but the program inside it—the one House never wrote, the one he quietly quarantined in his private servers—kept running.

Some say the hum is a distress call. Others say it’s a heartbeat. A few whisper that it’s a map.

But everyone agrees on one thing: whatever Vault 77 was hiding, this robot knew the way.
